# Use Docker Images

As we have introduced before, `image` is one of the 3 major components of Docker. 

Upon running docker container, it can run local image or if the image is not locally available, it will download from a registry.

In this chapter we will introduce more about `image`, including

* Pull images from registry

* Manage local images

* The mechanisms and implementaion of images
