# Docker Installation

Docker has 2 major editions, CE and EE. CE is the Community Edition(free, 7 month as a support cycle), while EE is the Enterprise Edition, which emphasizes on security, paid membership, and the support cycle is 24 months.

Docker CE has 3 update channels, **stable**, **test** and **nightly**, and releases a **stable** version every other 6 months(18.09, 19.03, 19.09...).

You can find the [Installation Guidance](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) at the official website. We mainly introduce Docker CE installation on Linux, Windows 10(PC) and macOS here.
